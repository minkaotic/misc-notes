## `WHERE` clauses
Negative condition
```sql
WHERE <column> != <value>
-- or
WHERE <column> <> <value>
```

Searching with a set of values
```sql
WHERE <column> IN (<value1>, <value2>, <value3>)
WHERE <column> NOT IN (<value1>, <value2>, <value3>)
```

Searching in a range (rather than using `>= <value1> AND <= <value2>`)
```sql
WHERE <column> BETWEEN <minimum> AND <maximum>
WHERE <column> NOT BETWEEN <minimum> AND <maximum>
```

Searching for a pattern (unlike `=`, it's case insensitive!)
```sql
WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%Fire"
WHERE title NOT LIKE "Harry Potter%Fire"
```

Searching for empty values
```sql
WHERE <column> IS NULL
WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL
```

## Modifying data
**Insert** values in the order of the columns prescribed in the schema
```sql
INSERT INTO <table> VALUES (<value 1>, <value 2>)
```

Insert values - flexible column/value order
- NB: specifying the columns like this allows us to leave out the values for columns that are nullable (by dropping them from both the list of columns and the list of values)
```sql
INSERT INTO <table> (<column 1>, <column 2>) VALUES (<value 1>, <value 2>);
```

Insert multiple rows
```sql
INSERT INTO <table> (<column 1>, <column 2>, ...) 
             VALUES 
                    (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...),
                    (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...),
                    (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```

**Update** values in a row
```sql
UPDATE <table> SET <column 1> = <value 1>, <column 2> = <value 2>;
```

**Delete** all rows from a table
```sql
DELETE FROM <table>;
```

## Transactions
- **Autocommit** is default: every statement you write gets saved to disk
- Switch autocommit off and begin a transaction: `BEGIN TRANSACTION;`
- To save all results of the statements executed since the start of the transaction to disk: `COMMIT;`
- To reset the state of the database to before the begining of the transaction: `ROLLBACK;`


## Ordering and Paging
Ordering by multiple column criteria (ordering is prioritized left to right):
```sql
SELECT * FROM <table> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC], <column2> [ASC|DESC];
```

To page through results, use the `OFFSET` keyword in conjunction with the `FETCH` keyword (`FETCH NEXT x ROWS ONLY` fulfils a similar purpose to `TOP` here) -
```sql
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> OFFSET <skipped rows> ROWS FETCH NEXT <# of rows> ROWS ONLY;
```

## String manipulation
Concatenating columns or values - either use the concatenation operator `+`:
```sql
SELECT <value or column> + <value or column> + <value or column>  FROM <table>;  
```
...or use the `CONCAT()` function.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(<value or column>, <value or column>, <value or column>) FROM <table>;

-- for example:
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM users
```

Uppercase or lowercase text
```SQL
SELECT UPPER(<value or column>) FROM <table>;
SELECT LOWER(<value or column>) FROM <table>;
```

Substring to shorten string values
```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(<value or column>, <start>, <length>) FROM <table>;
-- e.g.
SELECT name, SUBSTR(description, 1, 30) + '...' AS short_description, price FROM products;
```

Replace pieces of strings of text in a larger body of text
```sql
SELECT REPLACE(<original value or column>, <target string>, <replacement string>) FROM <table>;
-- e.g.
SELECT REPLACE(email, '@', '<at>') AS obfuscated_email FROM customers
```


## Aggregate and numeric functions
Obtain the **length** of a value using the `LENGTH()` function:
```sql
SELECT LENGTH(<value or column>) FROM <tables>;
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE LENGTH(<value or column>) > <value or column>

-- e.g. get the 5 longest product names:
SELECT TOP 5 name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM products ORDER BY name_length DESC
```

To count rows you can use the `COUNT()` function:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table>;

-- e.g. get all the product rows in the book category
SELECT COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE category = 'Books';
```

Use the `DISTINCT` keyword:
```sql
-- with COUNT() to count unique entries:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <column>) FROM <table>;

-- to show distinct values in a column:
SELECT DISTINCT <column> FROM <table>;
```

To count aggregated rows with common values, use the GROUP BY keywords:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(<column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <column with common value>;

-- e.g.:
SELECT category, count (*) as product_count FROM products GROUP BY category;
-- returns results in the below format!
```
|category   |product_count|
|-----------|-------------|
|Books      |20           |
|Clothing   |6            |
|Electronics|3            |


To total up numeric columns use the `SUM()` function:
```sql
SELECT SUM(<numeric column) FROM <table>;

-- e.g. get top 5 highest-spending customers
SELECT TOP 5 SUM(cost) as total_spent, user_id FROM orders
  GROUP BY user_id
  ORDER BY total_spent DESC
```

> :point_right: **NB: When using `GROUP BY`, use `HAVING` to specify conditions applying to the resulting groups**

A `HAVING` clause is like a `WHERE` clause, but applies only to groups as a whole (that is, to the rows in the result set representing groups), whereas the `WHERE` clause applies to individual rows:

```sql
SELECT SUM(<numeric column) AS <alias> FROM <table>
  GROUP BY <another column>
  HAVING <alias> <operator> <value>;

-- e.g. find all users who have spent over Â£250
SELECT SUM(cost) as total_spent, user_id FROM orders
  GROUP BY user_id
  HAVING total_spent > 250
  ORDER BY total_spent DESC
```

To get the average value of a numeric column use the `AVG()` function:

```sql
SELECT AVG(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;

-- e.g. get the average order value per customer
SELECT user_id, AVG(cost) AS average_cost FROM orders GROUP BY user_id;
```

To get the maximum or minimum value of a numeric column use the `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions:
```sql
SELECT MAX(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;
SELECT MIN(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;
```

You can also perform basic maths operations on numeric columns, using mathematical operators (/ * + -):
```sql
SELECT <numeric column> <mathematical operator> <numeric value> FROM <table>;
```

To round the results to the desired decimal point, use `ROUND(<value>, <no of decimal points>)`.
