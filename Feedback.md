Feedback
========
:point_right: part of a culture of learning and continuous improvement

Giving feedback is awkward... </br>
...whilst we figure out our personal style!

Every feeback situation is different

BUT there are Steps to getting better:
1. Learning about feedback
2. Having a process
3. Practicing


Important points about feedback
-------------------------------
1. People crave feedback - we generally want to know how we are doing

2. It's about perception
    - two people can see the same situation very differently
    - giving feedback means sharing your perception of the situation
    - it means relating how their behaviours impacted you/someone else
    - but important to stay open to all possibilities
    - watch their body language; listen for indicators that they see the situation differently
    - invite them to share how they saw the event: you might learn something

3. Intention matters
    - feedback should be motivated by your desire for the other person to be successful
    - use it to demonstrate you are invested in their growth and know they can improve
    - giving feedback to prove that you're right or show someone who's boss is a misuse of the process
    - [this is likely not a risk in our team, but mentally separating 'growth focus' from 'making someone feel bad' might also make giving feedback less icky]

4. Timing is key
   - Delaying redirecting feedback is a common pitfall (as it is hard to do)
   - but delaying it makes the feedback much less effective and is much more likely to cause resistance / negative feels
   - Ideally within 24h

5. It takes time to process feedback
   - The other person may not react positively in the moment
   - give them space to absorb the message

6. Vague feedback is not effective
   - Just telling someone they're great isn't useful feedback
   - make sure to be specific about the behaviour, and its impact
   - (same with redirecting fb)


Effective feedback process
--------------------------
1. OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR - "When you do X"
2. IMPACT - "Y happens"
3. FUTURE BEHAVIOUR - "Thank you!" or "Can you do that differently?"


Making redirecting feedback feel safe
-------------------------------------
e.g., someone's behaviour may not have been effective, and we want to help them be effective in the future!
- Give redirecting feedback in private / avoid group settings
- Maintain a neutral tone - the conversation is about behaviours, not about you or the person you are giving feedback to; emphasise this by not being apologetic, edgy, or otherwise emotional
- people change behaviours all the time; asking someone to change a behaviour does not mean undermining them as a person
- Focus strictly on observed behaviours, avoiding judgements e.g. "You had a strange attitute in that meeting"
- judgements tend to cause immediate resistance and get in the way of constructive exchange; big risk of losing the other person
- Rather than suggesting the future behaviour, try asking them a question like "How could this be improved?" and give them time and space to see what they come up with


Reinforcing feedback vs praise
------------------------------
- Praise is generic and doesn't say anything about what specifically a person did well - nor does it suggest that you really engage with / have thought about what they are doing
- it doesn't help them grow


Preparing to Give Feedback
--------------------------
- know their style - do they prefer a direct, no-nonsense approach? Or do they need a gentle, empathetic approach?
- confirm that it is a good time
  - "Can I share something with you?"
  - "Can I make an observation?"
  - "Can I give you some feedback?"
  - "Can we talk about what just happened?"


Receiving Feedback
------------------
(things you can do to encourage real and ongoing fb from others)
- ask for feedback ("What are some things I can do better?", "I'd like to know how I'm doing" - come up with more ideas together?)
- if you get fb that's too general, ask "can you share some more examples" / or "what specific behaviours can I work on"?
- Assume positive intent - even if words didn't come out perfectly; getting the delivery of reinforcing fb just right is really hard!
- Check in with yourself: if you are feeling defensive, it may be due to assuming ill intent
- Reframe what just happened: remind yourself that a message that sounds harsh is likely just poorly delivered, but is intended to help you improve your skills
- If you're struggling to reframe the message, be open about it - "I'm starting to feel defensive because it seems that you are implying that X...." - this transparency can help you stay in conversation with the other person, rather than shutting off
- Watch for patterns - have you received similar fb from more than one person?


Continuous Feedback is Comfortable Feedback
-------------------------------------------
Normalising feedback creates a culture where giving and receiving feedback is less difficult



In summary:
-----------
- feedback should be timely and specific
- having a process and practising it is key
